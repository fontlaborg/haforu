NEXT TASK: Sprint forward to complete the integration of 'fontsimi' with 'haforu', as outlined in @./PLAN.md and @./TODO.md and @./haforu/PLAN.md and @./haforu/TODO.md . Use the files @./WORK.md and @./haforu/WORK.md as the scratchpad for notes, but clean these files once you’ve completed a task, and also check off the completed tasks in @./PLAN.md and @./TODO.md and @./haforu/PLAN.md and @./haforu/TODO.md ;; NOTE: '@' denotes the start of a path but is not itself part of a path) ;; NOTE: KEEP this NEXTTASK.md file as is, DON’T CHANGE IT! ;;
